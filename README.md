# Youtube Scraper for Data Collection

### Usage
#### main.js

`git clone https://github.com/tabishnaqvi1311/youtube-scraper`

navigate to the working directory

`cd youtube-scraper`

then

`npm install`

to get views

`node main <video_id_goes_here>`

#### collective.js
The code reads a text file with video ids and iterates through it and writes the views to another file.

You will need to create a "id.txt" and "res.txt" and fill "id.txt" with data for that

This is how you would use it: 
`node collective`
